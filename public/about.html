<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Christine (Chris) Appis, a 54-year-old aspiring full-stack developer with a lifelong passion for technology. My journey into development started back in high school in 1988, but life took me on a different path. For the past 15 years, I stepped away from the workforce to care for my special needs nephew, an experience that taught me patience, resilience, and adaptability skills that now fuel my tech journey.

  With my nephew now in an environment that better supports his adult needs, I'm pursuing my lifelong dream of becoming a developer. I have a year and a half of Computer Science studies from Johnson & Wales University, but when my financial aid ran out with only eight classes left, I took matters into my own hands. I'm currently enrolled in Angela Yu's Full-Stack Web Development course on Udemy, a top-rated program that provides the hands-on experience traditional university courses often lack.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I love reading, hiking, cooking, and spending time with my family and pets. I've worn many hats throughout my life, holding both a Culinary Arts Certificate and an MBA from Johnson & Wales University. My background in business and leadership gives me a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, all essential skills in the tech world.

</p>

<p>Beyond tech, I also hold:

  An MBA from Johnson & Wales University, equipping me with strong business, leadership, and communication skills.
  An Associates degree in Criminal Justice, giving me a unique analytical perspective, valuable in areas like cybersecurity and IT problem-solving.
  A Culinary Arts Certificate, because creativity isn't just for coding!</p>
  <h3>My Strengths and Approach</h3>
<p>With a background in business, problem-solving, and leadership, I bring valuable skills to the table. I am committed, disciplined, and understand the importance of focus and follow-through. I know how to navigate challenges with a steady hand, and my ability to communicate effectively makes me well-suited for roles that require teamwork and collaboration.</p>
<p>I've learned that experience is an asset. I bring a mature, thoughtful approach to every project and am not afraid to take on new challenges. I don't need to compete with younger developers. I'm leveraging my strengths and strategically positioning myself for the next big opportunity.</p>

<h4>My Philosophy</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Focus with Purpose:</strong> Every action should move me forward. I eliminate distractions, commit deeply, and pursue excellence, not just completion.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Relentlessly:</strong> To truly master something, it has to be real. I build, break, and rebuild to hone my craft.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn Endlessly:</strong> Knowledge has no finish line. I remain hungry, humble, and committed to continuous learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Share Fearlessly:</strong> Growth multiplies when knowledge is shared. I teach, document, and contribute to the community.</li>
    <li><strong>Adapt Instinctively:</strong> Tech is always evolving. I embrace change, shift as needed, and evolve.</li>
    <li><strong>Evolve Relentlessly:</strong> My future self is counting on me. I keep going, keep growing, and never look back.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>My Next Steps</h3>
  <p>I am actively building projects, refining my full-stack development skills, and looking for opportunities to contribute, collaborate, and grow in the tech field. Whether through freelancing, open-source projects, or networking, I am determined to break into the industry and leverage my background in business, leadership, and problem-solving to bring value beyond just code.

    Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, hiking, cooking, and spending time with family, pets, and my partner of 33 years.
    
    I'm excited for what's ahead, and I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology, continuous learning, and making an impact.
