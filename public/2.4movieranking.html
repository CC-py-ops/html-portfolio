<h1>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h1>
<hr />
<h3>The Postman</h3>
<p>This 1997 film is a post-apocalyptic film directed by and starring Kevin Costner, based on the novel by David Brin. Set in a dystopian America ravaged by war and societal collapse, the story follows a drifter (Costner) who stumbles upon an old U.S. Postal Service uniform and inadvertently becomes a symbol of hope and resistance against a tyrannical warlord (Will Patton) and his brutal militia. As he revives the idea of a functioning postal service, his actions inspire scattered communities to rebuild civilization. Though the film was a box office failure and received mixed-to-negative reviews, it has since gained a small cult following for its themes of hope and resilience.</p>
<h3>Boys on the Side</h3>
<p>This 1995 comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross, starring Whoopi Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker, and Drew Barrymore. The story follows three women from different backgrounds who embark on a cross-country road trip that changes their lives. Jane (Goldberg), a singer, and Robin (Parker), a reserved real estate agent diagnosed with HIV, form an unlikely friendship and pick up Holly (Barrymore), a free-spirited woman fleeing an abusive relationship. As they travel together, they form a deep bond, confronting love, loss, and personal struggles along the way. The film is celebrated for its strong performances, heart-felt storytelling, and themes of friendship and resilience.</p>
<h3>The Hunger Games Series</h3>
<p>The Hunger Games franchise is a dystopian film series based on Suzanne Collins' bestselling novels. Set in the oppressive nation of Panem, the story follows Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a resourceful young woman who becomes a symbol of rebellion after volunteering to take her sister's place in the brutal, televised Hunger Games, an annual event where children fight to the death for the entertainment of the Capitol. As the series progresses across four films: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay Part 1, and Mockingjay Part 2, Katniss becomes the face of a growing revolution against the Capitol and its tyrannical leader, President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The franchise, known for its social commentary, strong performances, and action-packed storytelling, was a massive critical and commercial success, cementing its place as one of the defining film series of the 2010s.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>These movies are among my favorites because they each tell powerful stories of resilience, friendship, and hope in the face of adversity. The Postman resonates with its message of rebuilding society through small acts of courage, while Boys on the Side beautifully portrays the deep bonds of friendship that can form even in the most unexpected circumstances. The Hunger Games franchise captivates me with its strong, complex heroine and thought-provoking themes of resistance and survival. Each film, in its own way, explores the human spirits ability to endure hardship, fight for justice, and find connection, which is why they hold a special place in my heart.</p>
